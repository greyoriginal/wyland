        <h1>Biography </h1>
        <p>For Wyland, this journey began in early 2013, when singer-songwriter Ryan Sloan and pianist Pablo Techera, who had been in
          and out of several bands during their highschool years, decided to collaborate on something new. It wasn’t long before they
          realised that what they had just begun was going to become part of a much larger story. Helped by Craigslist, coincidences,
          and something which felt a little bit like fate, the pair set out to complete the fragments of an idea, and found along the
          way guitarist Mauricio Salazar, bassist Kara Delonas, and drummer Matt Pana. Despite the different members’ diverse backgrounds,
          they were united by a common dream: do what you love, share what you love, never let your feet touch the ground. It was this
          ethos which inspired both the band’s name, and its music. Wyland, a small-town band from the Garden State with a big-town dream,
          had just been born.
<br>
It’s the careful collision of influences which make Wyland’s sound what it is: a subtle blend of warm, atmospheric depth, arranged within a pop format. It’s music which both acknowledges, and builds upon the past; mixing the heartfelt lyrics and stand-out vocals of the people that kickstarted their musical journey- earlier U2 albums, Peter Gabriel and The Police, with ambient and acoustic beats inspired by artists such as M85 and Jon Hopkins. The result is an optimistic, reflective music, whose soaring vocals both address the present, and look to the future. It’s what the band themselves refer to as "transition music:" a sound which traces their own growth, and encourages others to do the same. A sound designed to inspire other young professionals to keep their head up against the swirling eddies of life.
<br>
It may have been under two years since its members first came together, but Wyland has no intention of touching down. Not only has the band already supported national acts such as Awolnation and Cold War Kids at the Center of the Universe festival, but as winners of the 2014 Break Contest, they’ve also had the chance to claim center stage at the Skate and Surf Festival of 2014. Now, on the verge of releasing their second EP, they’re ready to close their eyes, and take another leap. No one can tell what the future will hold, but Wyland are determined to keep on going up.</p> <span>Ryan Sloan, Pablo Techera, Mauricio Salazar, Kara Delonas, Matt Pana</span>
